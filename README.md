## 🚘 Features

### 🏆 For Riders & Drivers
- **AI-Based Ride Suggestions** – Recommends optimal rides based on past history, location, and traffic.
- **Live GPS Tracking** – Real-time location updates for both riders and drivers.
- **Secure Authentication** – Login via email, phone, or Google.
- **Ride Requests & Booking** – Request rides with estimated fare and driver arrival time.
- **Fare Calculation & Payment** – Dynamic fare estimation based on distance and traffic.
- **Carpooling Mode** – Matches riders with similar routes for cost savings.
- **Ratings & Reviews** – Riders and drivers can rate each other for better service quality.

### 🛠️ For Admin Panel
- **Monitor Live Rides** – View ongoing and completed rides in real-time.
- **Manage Users** – Approve, suspend, or track user activity.
- **Earnings Dashboard** – View ride transactions, payments, and commission earnings.
- **Data Analytics & Reports** – Insights on peak hours, revenue, and ride efficiency.

## 🤖 AI-Based Ride Suggestions

### 🚀 AI Matching Algorithm
1. **User Preferences & History** – AI learns from previous ride choices.
2. **Traffic & Route Optimization** – Uses real-time data for the best route selection.
3. **Demand Prediction** – Identifies peak hours to balance driver-rider ratio.
4. **Dynamic Pricing Adjustment** – Adjusts fares based on real-time conditions.
5. **Carpooling Optimization** – Matches riders with similar routes efficiently.

### 🔍 How AI Works?
- **Machine Learning models** process user behavior and ride data.
- **Real-time demand & supply balance** for efficient ride matching.
- **Predictive analytics** for optimized ride pricing and availability.

### 🌟 Best Practices
- **Follow MVC Architecture** – Keep models, controllers, and services separate.
- **Use `.env` files** – Store API keys and secrets securely.
- **Modular Code** – Keep functions reusable in utility files.
- **Use Async/Await** – Avoid callback hell for better readability.
- **Error Handling** – Centralized error handling using middleware.
- **Use WebSockets for Live Tracking** – Instead of polling, use **Socket.io** for real-time ride updates.
- **Optimize AI Processing** – Store user ride preferences locally and minimize server calls.
- **Implement Efficient Indexing** – Use indexes in MongoDB/PostgreSQL for faster query performance.
